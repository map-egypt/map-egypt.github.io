    - MAP Egypt is a monitoring tool that keeps track of agricultural development projects in Egypt and their socio-economic context. The ultimate goal of the tool is to improve agricultural project planning, coordination and effectiveness. Specifically, MAP Egypt helps the Government,  development partners, researchers and other interested parties to gain a quick overview of the state of agriculture in Egypt at the aggregate and the project level. The tool has been developed for and with the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MALR) by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in collaboration with Development Seed and as part of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded-project called “Evaluating Impact and Building Capacity” (EIBC).
    - In order to effectively allocate funds, build synergies and evaluate future proposals, users can visualize and monitor the status and progress of agricultural projects categorized by sector, location, donor or common objectives, as well as track key performance indicators related to the project. In order to contextualize projects and evaluate which governorates /districts require further assistance, users can also quickly map, zoom in and chart a wide-range of indicators on food and nutrition security, poverty and development across Egypt, with a focus on monitoring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Egypt’s Sustainable Development Strategy (SDS) - on the national and subnational level.
